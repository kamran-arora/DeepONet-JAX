# DeepONet implementation in JAX using Equinox 

We implement a simple Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) introduced in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03193) using JAX and Equinox.

We use the original implementation in the [DeepXDE](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library as a reference.

The notebooks folder contains an example notebook where we train a DeepONet on the antiderivative dataset from DeepXDE which can be found [here](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/demos/operator/antiderivative_aligned.html).
